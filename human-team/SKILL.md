name: human-team
description: Creative multi-agent team (OpenSquad) that turns an idea, reference, or existing material into a structured full production — brief, plan, dossier, concept, script, art direction, storyboard, production sheet, teaser/main/secondary assets, ads in 9:16/4:5/16:9, copy-pack, Notion calendar, and handoff. Image rendering asks the user to choose Magnific (free default) or Higgsfield (paid); video is always Higgsfield (Seedance/Kling). Use whenever the user asks for "full campaign", "creative team", "virtual agency", "multi-agent production", "OpenSquad", "turn this reference into a campaign", "I have a product brief and want the whole package — images, ads, copies, emails, and calendar", "improve this script with the team", "finish this campaign". Triggers (EN/PT) — full campaign, creative squad, multi-agent pipeline, OpenSquad, campanha completa, time criativo, agência virtual, produção multi-agente, brief de produto pacote completo. Routes to the default creative squad (not a generic menu).

# Human Team

Creative multi-agent team based on OpenSquad. Takes an idea/reference/material and returns structured production with human approval at checkpoints.

## Preflight — confirm the render provider is ready (first run)

Before the first render in a session, confirm the chosen provider is actually connected. Do not assume it is.

- Magnific (default, free): verify the Magnific MCP is connected — a quick account/credit balance check is the cheapest probe. If the Magnific MCP tools are not available, the connector is not set up.
- Higgsfield (paid): verify the higgsfield CLI is installed and logged in (e.g. higgsfield whoami). If the command is missing or not authenticated, it is not set up.

If the required provider is NOT ready:
1. Tell the user plainly which dependency is missing.
2. Route them to the human-setup skill for step-by-step, OS-specific setup (Mac/Windows).
3. Never hard-fail: meanwhile deliver the final English prompt ready to copy plus the exact provider command, so the user has something actionable immediately.

Only proceed to render once the provider is confirmed ready.

## Visual generation routing

<!-- IMAGE_GENERATION_ROUTE_RULE -->
> Image generation rule: always use `imageprompts.md` as the creative/prompt guide when present. Before rendering any image, ask the user to choose: **Magnific** via direct MCP/API (`nano-banana-pro-flash`, `resolution: "1K"`, intended free/default) or **Higgsfield** via MCP/CLI (paid). Do not use `mcp__magnific_oauth.images_generate` for routine Magnific image generation unless explicitly requested; use `magnific-oauth.account_balance` only to check/measure credits.
<!-- /IMAGE_GENERATION_ROUTE_RULE -->

**Default: Magnific (free).** Before the visual phase begins, briefly tell the user *"Going with Magnific (free) for the campaign images — switch to Higgsfield (paid)?"* If they don't push back, proceed with Magnific. If they ask for Higgsfield, switch. **Never silently render on Higgsfield.**

Ask once at the start of the visual phase; the choice applies to teaser + main + secondary assets + ads. Video render is always Higgsfield (Seedance/Kling).

## Language

Mirror the user's language. Deliverables (briefs, scripts, copy) are produced in the target audience language — ask if not obvious.

## Complete intelligence

- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — general OpenSquad rules
- [README.md](README.md) — overview
- [squads/team/](./squads/team) — default creative squad
  - `pipeline/` — execution pipeline
  - `pipeline/data/campaign-delivery-system.md` — central reference for full campaign
  - `agents/` — specialized agents (Planner, Art Director, Producer, Social Manager, Content Multiplier…)
- [_opensquad/core/](./_opensquad/core) — OpenSquad engine + base prompts
- [skills/](./skills) — helper skills
- [dashboard/](./dashboard) — local Vite/React/Phaser dashboard (optional)
- [BUD/](./BUD) — auxiliary resources
- [.mcp.json](.mcp.json) — MCP config

## Routing by intent

The skill **does not open a generic menu**. It identifies the entry mode immediately:

1. **Start from scratch** — just an idea
2. **Continue a base** — existing material
3. **Improve something** — refine script/piece
4. **Analyze reference** — extract angle from example
5. **Finalize production** — close what's missing
6. **Full campaign** — full scope → activates `campaign-delivery-system.md`

In full-campaign mode: Planner defines the package → Art Director handles visual identity and continuity → Producer organizes assets and folders → Social Manager builds Notion MCP/CSV calendar → Content Multiplier closes derivatives and copies.

## Full-campaign delivery

- `projeto.md` with objective, audience, promise, channels, formats, success criteria, risks
- Teaser + main + secondary assets with continuity of outfit/look/product
- Ads in 9:16, 4:5, 16:9 with headline, primary text, CTA, safe zones
- `copy-pack.md` with campaign copy, posts, ads, emails, CTAs, voiceover
- Calendar ready for Notion MCP or CSV import
- `handoff.md` with files, pendings, external tools, next actions

## Non-negotiable rules

- **Do not skip human checkpoints.**
- Video only after frames are approved.
- Always ask the image routing question (Magnific vs Higgsfield) before rendering.
- Video render: Higgsfield (Seedance/Kling).
- Notion MCP is optional.
- Before generating any visual asset: confirm project, quantity, aspect ratio, resolution, references, purpose, output folder.

## Possible dependencies

- Claude Code, Node/npm/npx
- Playwright/MCP (web investigation)
- Notion MCP (calendar)
- OpenSquad engine (bundled)
- Magnific MCP/API or Higgsfield CLI logged in

## Final delivery
